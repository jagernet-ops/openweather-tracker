# 🐈 Weather-Tracker 🌧️
A simple weather tracking web-app utilizing openweathermap's free API!
## How to Use?
Simply enter the name of the city who's weather you'd like to request and the website fetches it for you. What will be returned is the current temperature in Fahrenheit (Celcius Button), the forecast for the following week, and pretty icons to display the current weather.
## What is Weather-Tracker's Purpose?
Weather-Tracker is yet another practice project for developing my skills in web development. This project deals with my ability to handle processing data from API's and utilizing it to create smart websites.

-- Stay Safe and Warm!
